# Skystorm Network

Skystorm Network is an in-developpement network created by Rix56.

The code is very bad, since i'm a bad developer. (¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

# How to be an admin ?

Go to PhpMyAdmin (if you don't have that, then download it ! it's a very useful tool for manage DBs.) and go to the database of your Skystorm Network installation,

and then go to users, select your user, and modify the column "class", and change memeber to admin.
